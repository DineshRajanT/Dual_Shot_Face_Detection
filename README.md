# Dual_Shot_Face_Detection
* Face detection with better accuracy is one of the hottest topics of the deep learning world..However
        * some good models tries their best to achieve better results in all circumstances.
        
* I am working on face detection I have tried cvlib which is a light weight detection model....
        * But sometimes it fails to capture some faces in certain conditions
        
* Mtcnn is also tried to capture crop faces but the faces are blur due to motion of person walking.

* I have Mi cameras which gives out 1920 x 1080 p images but still the same motion blur issues persist.
       
* Curious to learn about Dual Shot face Detection and I have tried it with my own dataset.The results good though

* Some of the main attributes I considered for facial data :                        
               1) Blur     
               2) Surface_Area   
               3) Confidence score    
               4) Area of the eye
